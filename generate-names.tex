\section{A New Approach to Generate Descriptive Test Names}
\label{sec:generate-names}

For the second piece of my dissertation work, I plan to develop an approach to generate descriptive test names.
%
This piece contains three components.
%
The first component is an empirical study of naming rationales that investigates whether test are named after what makes them unique.
%
The second component is an automated approach to extract unique attributes of unit tests.
%
And the last component is a new approach to generate descriptive test names primarily based on the unique attributes identify by the tool created in the second component.
