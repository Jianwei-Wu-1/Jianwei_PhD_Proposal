\subsection{A Concept-based Approach to Improve Test Names with a Uniqueness based Naming Rationale}
\label{sec:unique-test-name}

In the first part of work, I consider investigating if tests are named after what makes them unique, and use the produced results to create a concept-based approach that can provide a uniqueness-based naming rationale for developers.
%
Before start to construct the uniqueness-based naming rationale, I first need to know whether unit tests are named after what makes them unique or not.
%
Therefore, an empirical study was conducted to check our thoughts and assumptions, and a set of top-level and secondary codes was formulated using selective coding~\cite{glaser1967discovery,strauss1998basics}.
%
Moreover, the naming rationales that were investigated in the this study will be used to solve the naming problem of unit tests from other perspectives.
%
The set of codes are used to tag the tests and extract the tagged text from those tests in the concept-based approach, which is capable of check if a test is named after what makes it unique and improve the uniqueness of that test name by utilizing the unique information from the tagged text.
