\subsection{Research Plan}

\textbf{---To be changed---}

The research plan of all proposed work contains four steps.
%
The first step has been done in my preliminary work that is to build a pattern-based approach to detect and improve non-descriptive test names.
%
The second step is to conduct an empirical study about if tests are named after what makes them unique and gain the knowledge of basic naming rationales, which is the foundation of all following work.
%
The third step is to develop and implement a concept-based approach to tag the tests with a specific block of text that shows the uniqueness of tests, and improve existing test names with the extracted uniqueness.
%
This step will be done as the first part of the planned future work.
%
The last step is targeting at investigating if the physical shape of the test name can affect how developers understand the test, and I plan to propose an innovative, shape-based approach to automatically generate descriptive test names that can reflect the information contained in the shape of the tests.
