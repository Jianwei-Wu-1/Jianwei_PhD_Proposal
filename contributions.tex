In this proposal, I propose three research directions that focus on systematically providing descriptive and unique names for unit tests.
%
In the preliminary work, first, I propose a pattern-based approach to detect and improve non-descriptive test names, and an empirical study that investigates if unit tests are named after what makes them unique.
%
The pattern-based approach and the empirical study combine pattern mining, static program analysis, NLPA, selective coding, and quantitative analysis. 
%
Besides the preliminary work, I first plan to use the results from the empirical study to develop a concept-based approach that provides a uniqueness-based naming rationale for unit tests.
%
Secondly, I plan to create a shape-based approach that can measure if the physical appearance (i.e., length, camel case, etc.), descriptiveness, and uniqueness of test names can affect how developers understand those tests using a eye tracking method.

The following list presents a summary of my contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a new, pattern-based approach that can detect and improve non-descriptive test names
    \item a novel, concept-based approach that can check if a test is named after what makes it unique and help developers improve existing test names with uniqueness
    \item an innovative, shape-based approach that can measure if the physical appearance, descriptiveness, and uniqueness of test names can affect how developers understand those tests.
\end{enumerate}.

I anticipate that my research can systematically help test developers to identify and improve existing test names with descriptiveness and uniqueness.

At the same time, quality and maintainability of unit tests could be significantly improved by using my approaches.
