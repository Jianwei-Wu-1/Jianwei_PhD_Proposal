In this proposal, I propose a systematic approach to provide descriptive names for unit tests.
%
In the preliminary work, first, I developed a pattern-based approach to detect and improve non-descriptive test names.
%
Second, an empirical study to investigate if unit tests are named after what makes them unique was conducted to motivate the following work.
%
Based on the findings of the empirical study, I further proposed an automated approach to identify unique attributes of unit tests.
%
Finally, I plan to create a name generation approach to provide descriptive test names that meet with develop approval.
%
Moreover, this approach would be built on top of the comprehensive naming rationale that I will investigate and formalize.


The following list presents a summary of my contributions:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item a novel, pattern-based approach that can detect and improve non-descriptive test names
    \item a new, name generation approach that can provide descriptive names based on a comprehensive naming rationale for unit tests
\end{enumerate*}.
%
I anticipate that my research can systematically help developers both detect non-descriptive test names and generate descriptive names for the poorly named tests.
%
For example, developers could use the generated names to replace the non-descriptive names, which significantly increase the readability of their unit tests (i.e., consider unit tests as a part of software documentation).
%
At the same time, quality and maintainability of unit tests could be greatly improved by using my approaches.
