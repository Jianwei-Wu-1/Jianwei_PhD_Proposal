Unit tests are an important artifact that supports the software development process in several ways.
%
For example, when a test fails, its name can provide the first step towards understanding the purpose of the test.
%
Unfortunately, prior work has shown that tests often do not have descriptive names. 
%
To address this limitation, some techniques have been developed to automatically generate descriptive names.
%
Moreover, other techniques provided useful suggestions to improve existing test names.
%
However, they are preliminary in the sense that they are good at delivering their generated names or showing potential improvements but failed to consider the need of developers.


The proposal focuses on providing descriptive names for existing unit tests based on the intuition that tests are often named after what makes them unique.
%
My dissertation work is divided into two pieces.
%
For the first piece, in order to know which tests need descriptive names, I propose a novel, pattern-based approach to detect and improve non-descriptive test names.
%
For the second piece, in order to generate descriptive test names that meet with developers approval, I propose a new, descriptive name generation approach for unit tests, which is primarily based on the extracted attributes of a given test that make it unique among its siblings.
