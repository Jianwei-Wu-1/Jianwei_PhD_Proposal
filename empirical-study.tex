\subsection{An Empirical Study of Unit Test Naming Rationales}
\label{sec:emp-study}

As the first step towards generating descriptive test names, I conducted an empirical study to understand existing test naming rationales.
%
Using the results of this study, first, I would acknowledge how unit tests are named by developers in different real-world scenarios.
%
Second, a comprehensive test naming rationale could be formed to be the basis of generating descriptive names for unit tests.
