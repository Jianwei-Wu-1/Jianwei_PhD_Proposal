\subsection{An Empirical Study of Unit Test Naming Rationales}
\label{sec:emp-study}

As the first component towards generating descriptive test names, I conducted an empirical study to understand existing test naming rationales.
%
Our intuition is that developers often name unit tests based on what aspects of the test makes the test unique among its siblings.
%
To validate this assumption, we conducted an empirical study of \num{440} existing tests.
%
First, we examined each test in order to identify what makes it unique from its siblings.
%
Then we examined the testâ€™s name and judged whether the name is based either entirely or in part on the unique aspect of the test.


\subsubsection{Study Methodology}

As the first part of this study, I randomly selected a set of \num{440} tests from \num{11} open-source projects from Github.
%
Moreover, I used an open, axial, and selective coding process to qualitatively analyze the tests.
%
Finally, I discussed the results of the coding process and the data to answer two research questions about whether unit tests are named, either wholly or in part, after what makes a given test unique among its siblings.
